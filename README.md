# Controller for UCLan SmartBuilding

> UCLan has decided to convert the C&T building into a ‘Smart Building’ controlled by a custom
written application. During the first iteration of the system, the university would like the system
to control the doors, lights and fire alarm. Using C# and the NUnit 3 unit testing framework, you
are to take a ‘test driven development’ approach to develop and unit test a single class in this
system, the BuildingController class.
